# Furry Friend Finder

Furry Friend Finder is a simple website I built using the petfinder API.

It takes a simple input of the age of a dog, zipcode, and distance from the zip code, and return 10 dogs that are adoptable within that range!

The webiste will display a slideshow with each slide being a:
1) Photo of the dog
2) Name and link to the petfinder site that allows you to look into said dog more!

requirements.txt included. using Flask, requests, and requests cache
